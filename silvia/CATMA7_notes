## A brief Introduction: What is CATMA?

[CATMA](https://catma.de/), or  **Computer Assisted Text Markup and Analysis**, is a free open source tool for text annotation, analysis and visualization that supports collaborative work.<br>

It is made up of 4 modules, which are briefly sketched as follows but will be discussed in greater detail :

| Module | Description|
|--------|------------|
|PROJECT | Where you manage your project resources|
| TAGS   | It enables you to add, edit and deleting tagsets|
| ANNOTATE | It allows you to annotate your text, edit and delete annotations |
| ANALYZE | It offers the opportunity to analyze your text, but also to do visualization and semi-automatic annotation|

Text and annotation can be searched and analyzed using the **built in query language** based on different criteria, such as word frequency, annotation category or similarity to other words and annotations (?).<br>
The results of query can be visualized and explored using the distribution graph or the word cloud, for example.<br>

### Part 1 - Project preparation and Annotation
  - #### Account and Login
  
First of all, in order to use CATMA you need to create an account.

_If you want to log in and start your session on CATMA_: https://app.catma.de/

As for the account, you can either use a Google account or a private e-mail.<br>
After signing up, you will receive a verification e-mail to the address you used for registration.<br>
Once your e-mail adress has been verified, you will be able to complete your profile by choosing username and password. <br>
Sign in to access the project overview, and you'll be all set to begin your first project.

  - #### Project Overview

![alt text](image.png "The project overview")

You will see that you have the option to either create or join a project. Moreover there is a sidebar on the left with all the modules introduced earlier, which will be deactivated. In fact, if you click on the sidebar it won't work. But don't worry, it will be activated as soon as you enter your project.<br>
The sidebar will guide you through the different modules.

- #### Project module

As soon as you enter the project module by selecting the project you want to work on, you will see all the components of your project:

![alt text](image-2.png "This is a project I've created")
_Here I've created a new project and given it a name._

![alt text](image-3.png "If you click on the project you'll see all its components")
_These are the components of the project._

The project module allows you to manage those components, each displayed in a tile. As you can see there is a tile for documents and annotations, one for the tagsets and one for the project members.<br>
In the tile "Documents & Annotations", if you click on the "+ symbol" you can upload documents from your local computer or you can simply add an URL.
