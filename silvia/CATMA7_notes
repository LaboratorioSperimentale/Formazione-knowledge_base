# Digital Text Annotation and Analysis with CATMA 7

## A brief Introduction: What is CATMA?

[CATMA](https://catma.de/), or  **Computer Assisted Text Markup and Analysis**, is a free open source tool for text annotation, analysis and visualization that supports collaborative work.<br>

It is made up of 4 modules:

| Module | Description|
|--------|------------|
|PROJECT | Where you manage your project resources|
| TAGS   | It enables you to add, edit and deleting tagsets|
| ANNOTATE | It allows you to annotate your text, edit and delete annotations |
| ANALYZE | It offers the opportunity to analyze your text, but also to do visualization and semi-automatic annotation|

Text and annotation can be searched and analyzed using the **built in query language** based on different criteria, such as word frequency, annotation category or similarity to other words and annotations.<br>
The results of query can be visualized and explored using a few simple visualizations such as the distribution graph or the word cloud, for example.<br>
