[Jon W. Carr](https://joncarr.net/) is currently a postdoc at Royal Holloway, University of London. Broadly, he’s interested in the interaction between human behavior and cultural phenomena, with a particular emphasis on how language shapes – and is shaped by – cognition. He’s been exploring these issues with computational models (typically Bayesian) and behavioral experiments (typically artificial language learning).
