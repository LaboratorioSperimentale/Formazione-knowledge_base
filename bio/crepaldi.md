[Davide Crepaldi](https://dbbs.dip.unipv.it/it/node/210) is neuropsychologist turned experimental psychologist turned cognitive neuroscientist — always being a computational modeller wannabe in the process. He’s been leading a [research group at SISSA](https://lrlac.sissa.it/), Trieste, for about 10 years, and is now in the process of moving to the University of Pavia. He’s interested in language and reading, and how their processing might be grounded into language-agnostic computational and neural machinery.
